ABOUT
=====

Modifies a RHEL 6.4+ x86_64 Workstation or Server DVD with a kickstart
that will install a system that is configured with the DISA STIG for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The kickstart script involves the integration of the following projects
into a single installer:

   - stig-fix-1.7.8.el6.noarch.rpm (Hardening scripts from DISA STIG RPM scripts)

        https://github.com/RedHatGov/stig-fix-el6

   - classification-banner.py (Python for displaying graphical classification banner)

        https://github.com/RedHatGov/classification-banner

   - SCAP Security Guide (SSG) Content - Benchmark for the system after installation

        https://github.com/OpenSCAP/scap-security-guide

   - DOD Firefox Plugin

            CAs would need to be added and repackaged via taring up the
            .mozilla directory - placed in /etc/skel for all users.

        scap-security-guide-0.1-17.el6.noarch.rpm

            WILL BE REMOVED WITH RHEL 6.6 (SSG will be part of baseline)

            Currently I use ths SSG Scripts to take a benchmark to save in
            root after installation.
